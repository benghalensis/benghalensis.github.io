Welcome. As a Master's student at the <a href='https://www.washington.edu/'>University of Washington</a>, my primary areas of study include Robotics, Localization, SLAM, and Computer Vision. I am currently contributing to DARPA's Robotic Autonomy in Complex Environments with Resiliency (RACER) program under the guidance of Prof. Byron Boots.


In my academic journey, I had the opportunity to collaborate with <a href='https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~mcakmak/'>Prof. Maya Cakmak</a> and Prof. <a href='https://www.cs.washington.edu/people/faculty/jrs'>Prof. Joshua R Smith</a> on the Amazon-UW Robotics Manipulation Research. This project entailed generating robot grasps for unfamiliar objects using RGBD cameras. Furthermore, my research experience extends to a project with <a href='http://faculty.washington.edu/ashisb/'>Prof. Ashis Banerjee</a> at the <a href='http://depts.washington.edu/uwsmarts/index.html'>SMARTS</a> lab, focusing on object pose prediction via vision-based methodologies.

In the professional sphere, I am currently an intern at <a href='https://www.thirdwave.ai/'>Third Wave Automation</a>, where my role involves LiDAR-based localization within warehouse contexts. My previous industry experience includes working as a Perception Intern at <a href='https://voaige.com/'>Voaige</a> where I further developed my expertise in object grasping technology.
